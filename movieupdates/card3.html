      <p>RRR is an upcoming Indian Telugu-language period action drama film directed by S. S. Rajamouli, and produced by D. V. V. Danayya of DVV Entertainments. The film stars N. T. Rama Rao Jr., Ram Charan, Ajay Devgn, Alia Bhatt and Olivia Morris while Samuthirakani, Alison Doody, Ray Stevenson and Shriya Saran play supporting roles. It is a fictional story about two Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (Rama Rao), who fought against the British Raj and Nizam of Hyderabad respectively.

        Rajamouli scripted the film from the original story written by K. V. Vijayendra Prasad. Rajamouli came across reading stories about the incidents happened in the lives of Rama Raju and Bheem, and connected the coincidence between them. The thought that how they could have been friends during their formative years inspired Rajamouli to make the film. Set in 1920, the plot explores the undocumented period in their lives when both the revolutionaries choose to go into oblivion before they began the fight for their country.

  The film was formally announced in March 2018, with the launch and the principal photography of the film began in November 2018 in Hyderabad. The film was shot extensively across India, with a few sequences in Ukraine and Bulgaria. The film's soundtrack and background score is composed by M. M. Keeravani with cinematography by K. K. Senthil Kumar and editing by A. Sreekar Prasad. Sabu Cyril is the film's production designer whilst V. Srinivas Mohan supervised the visual effects.

  Made on a budget of ₹400 crore (US$53 million), RRR was initially scheduled for theatrical release on 30 July 2020, which has been deferred due to production delays and followed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, the film is scheduled to be released theatrically on 7 January 2022.</p>
