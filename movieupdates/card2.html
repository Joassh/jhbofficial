      <p>Beast is an upcoming Indian Tamil-language black comedy action thriller film written and directed by Nelson Dilipkumar and produced by Sun Pictures. The film stars Vijay and Pooja Hegde, with Selvaraghavan, Yogi Babu, Shine Tom Chacko, Redin Kingsley, VTV Ganesh, Aparna Das, Lilliput Faruqui, Ankur Ajit Vikal, Sathish Krishnan and Redin Kingsley in supporting roles.<br>

The production rights of Vijay's 65th film as lead actor, which was tentatively titled Thalapathy 65, were acquired by Sun Pictures in early January 2020, and the film set to be written and directed by AR Murugadoss. However, the producers ousted Murugadoss from the film in October 2020, after he refused to cut his renumeration. Nelson was later hired, and wrote a new script for the film.<br>

With an official announcement during December 2020, the film was launched during March 2021 and principal photography took place that following month (April 2021). Irrespective of shooting being interrupted due to the second wave of COVID-19 and the lockdown in Tamil Nadu, filming resumed during July 2021 and ended that December. It was shot across various locations in Chennai, including a specially designed set resembling that of a shopping mall where most of the film was shot, whilst sporadic schedules also took place in Delhi and Georgia. The music is composed by Anirudh Ravichander, whilst cinematography was handled by Manoj Paramahamsa, editing by R. Nirmal and production design supervised by D. R. K. Kiran, respectively.

Beast is scheduled to release in 2022.</p>

       The music is composed by Anirudh Ravichander in his third collaboration with Vijay and Nelson. The album for Beast will reportedly have five songs and six theme tracks; three of the tracks were picturised on Vijay and Pooja Hegde, including a romantic single. Media reports had claimed that the introductory track in the Arabic music genre, which had vocals by Anirudh himself and features lyrics in Tamil and Arabic languages; it is considered to be released as the first single from the album.<br>

For the music sessions, Anirudh saw the shooting of the film in Chennai in mid-July 2021; he said that he could easily work on the compositions, instead of approaching the actor and director for narrating a particular sequence, so that he could get an idea of how the song for that scene could be materialised. It has been reported that Sivakarthikeyan would contribute to the soundtrack, penning one of the tracks which was reportedly sung by Vijay, his subsequent third collaboration with Anirudh as a singer, after "Selfie Pulla" from Kaththi, and "Kutti Story" from Master.<br>

By early-November 2021, it was reported that Anirudh had completed composing all the songs for the album.The team planned to release the aforementioned first single audio track on the composer's birthday (16 October 2021) and later scheduled for release on Diwali (4 November), which however did not happen. The reason for the delay is due to Sun Pictures' commitments to the release of Rajinikanth-starrer Annaatthe, and also the death of Puneeth Rajkumar insisted the makers not to release any update regarding the film on that festival.It has been reported that the first single of the film will release on New Year's Eve.
