      <p>Valimai (transl.â€‰Power) is an upcoming Indian Tamil-language action thriller film written and directed by H. Vinoth, and produced by Zee Studios and Boney Kapoor under Bayview Projects LLP.The film stars Ajith Kumar, Huma Qureshi and
        Kartikeya
        Gummakonda in the lead roles. The film's music is composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja, whilst cinematography performed by Nirav Shah and editing by Vijay Velukutty.

        This film marked the second collaboration between Ajith, Vinoth and Kapoor after Nerkonda Paarvai (2019). Vinoth, wrote the script in mid-2018 even before the production of the film began, as Ajith initially declined the script and work on it
        later. The film was launched on 18 October 2019, with the official title was announced and principal photography began during December 2019 in Hyderabad and was completed with February 2021, irrespective of the film's production being
        disrupted
        due to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in India. While major portions of the film were shot across Chennai and Hyderabad, the team needed to shoot a sequence in a foreign location, but was delayed due to the restrictions imposed on
        international
        travel. After multiple locations being zeroed for the schedule, the makers shot few sequences in Russia during mid-August, where filming took place for seven days, and was wrapped on September 2021.

        The film was in the news due to the persuasion of fans to launch an update regarding the project, as a result, being listed one of "the most-anticipated Tamil film" according to the trade circuits.The film, which was originally intended for a
        theatrical release during 2020, was delayed as production came to halt due to the COVID-19 lockdown, and is now scheduled to release on 13 January 2022, coinciding with Pongal.</p>
